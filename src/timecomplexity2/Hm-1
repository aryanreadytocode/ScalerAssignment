    What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?

    for(int i=3; i<n/3; i += 3){
         for(int j=2; j<n/2; j+= 2){
          // 0(1) operation
         }
    }

    Choose the correct answer from below:
    O ( n )
    O ( n ^ 3)
    O ( n ^ 2)
    O ( n ^ (1/3) )
    None of these
